abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has already taken off, together with many Web of Things (WoT) off-the-shelf devices, such as Philips Hue lights and platforms such as Azure IoT. These devices and platforms define their own way of describing the interactions with the devices and do not support the recently published WoT standards by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). On the other hand, many hardware components that are popular in developer and maker communities lack a programming language independent platform to integrate these components into the WoT, similar to npm and pip for software packages. To solve these problems and nurture the adoption of the W3C WoT, in this paper, we propose a platform to WoTify either existing hardware by downloading new software in them or already existing IoT and WoT devices by describing them with a Thing Description.},

abstract = {A central concern in the area of pervasive computing has been the integration of digi- tal artifacts with the physical world and vice-versa. Recent developments in the field of embedded devices have led to smart things increasingly populating our daily life. We define smart things as digitally enhanced physical objects and devices that have commu- nication capabilities. Application domains are for instance wireless sensor and actuator networks in cities making them more context-aware and thus smarter. New appliances such as smart TVs, alarm clocks, fridges or digital-picture frames make our living-rooms and houses more energy efficient and our lives easier. Industries benefit from increasingly more intelligent machines and robots. Usual objects tagged with radio-tags or barcodes become linked to virtual information sources and offer new business opportunities. As a consequence, Internet of Things research is exploring ways to connect smart things together and build upon these networks.},
