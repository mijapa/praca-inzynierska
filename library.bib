Rather than exposing real-world data and functionality through proprietary and tightly-coupled systems, several projects suggest to make them an integral part of the Web. As a result, smart things become easier to build upon and the scalability and evolvability of the Web can be leveraged. In this paper we look at "physical mashups", were tech-savvy create lightweight, ad-hoc applications on top of smart things just as they currently create Web 2.0 mashups. We present the early version of a mashup framework that provides services for composing things and illustrate this by means of two mashup editors. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {In the “Internet of Things” vision, the physical world be- comes integrable with computer networks. Embedded com- puters or visual markers on everyday objects allow things and information about them to be accessible in the digi- tal world. However, this integration is based on competing standards and requires custom solutions, thus requires ex- tensive time and technical expertise. Based on the success of Web 2.0 mashup applications, we propose a similar ap- proach for integrating real-world devices to the Web, allow- ing for them to be easily combined with other virtual and physical resources. In this paper we discuss possible inte- gration method, in particular how the REST principles can be applied to embedded devices. Then we illustrate these principles with two concrete implementations: on the Sun SPOT platform and on the Ploggs wireless energy monitors. Finally, we show how RESTful interactions can be leveraged to quickly create new prototypes and mashups that combine the physical and virtual world.},

abstract = {A central concern in the area of pervasive computing has been the integration of digi- tal artifacts with the physical world and vice-versa. Recent developments in the field of embedded devices have led to smart things increasingly populating our daily life. We define smart things as digitally enhanced physical objects and devices that have commu- nication capabilities. Application domains are for instance wireless sensor and actuator networks in cities making them more context-aware and thus smarter. New appliances such as smart TVs, alarm clocks, fridges or digital-picture frames make our living-rooms and houses more energy efficient and our lives easier. Industries benefit from increasingly more intelligent machines and robots. Usual objects tagged with radio-tags or barcodes become linked to virtual information sources and offer new business opportunities. As a consequence, Internet of Things research is exploring ways to connect smart things together and build upon these networks.},

abstract = {Since the term was first coined in the late 1990s, the "Internet of Things" has promised a smart, interconnected world enabling your toaster to text you when your breakfast is ready, and your sweatshirt to give you status updates during your workout. This rise of "smart products" such as Internet-enabled appliances has the potential to revolutionize both business and society. But the smart wave will not stop with stuff with related trends such as the Internet of Bodies now coming into vogue. It seems that, if anything, humanity is headed toward an Internet of Everything. Yet it is an open question whether security and privacy protections can or will scale along with this increasingly crowded field, and whether law and policy can keep up with these developments. This Article explores what lessons the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) and Governing Knowledge Commons (GKC) Frameworks hold for promoting security and privacy, in an Internet of Everything, with special treatment regarding the promise and peril of blockchain technology to build trust in such a massively distributed network. Particular attention is paid to governance gaps in this evolving ecosystem, and what state, federal, and international policies are needed to better address security and privacy failings.

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has already taken off, together with many Web of Things (WoT) off-the-shelf devices, such as Philips Hue lights and platforms such as Azure IoT. These devices and platforms define their own way of describing the interactions with the devices and do not support the recently published WoT standards by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). On the other hand, many hardware components that are popular in developer and maker communities lack a programming language independent platform to integrate these components into the WoT, similar to npm and pip for software packages. To solve these problems and nurture the adoption of the W3C WoT, in this paper, we propose a platform to WoTify either existing hardware by downloading new software in them or already existing IoT and WoT devices by describing them with a Thing Description.},
