abstract = {A central concern in the area of pervasive computing has been the integration of digi- tal artifacts with the physical world and vice-versa. Recent developments in the field of embedded devices have led to smart things increasingly populating our daily life. We define smart things as digitally enhanced physical objects and devices that have commu- nication capabilities. Application domains are for instance wireless sensor and actuator networks in cities making them more context-aware and thus smarter. New appliances such as smart TVs, alarm clocks, fridges or digital-picture frames make our living-rooms and houses more energy efficient and our lives easier. Industries benefit from increasingly more intelligent machines and robots. Usual objects tagged with radio-tags or barcodes become linked to virtual information sources and offer new business opportunities. As a consequence, Internet of Things research is exploring ways to connect smart things together and build upon these networks.},

abstract = {In the “Internet of Things” vision, the physical world be- comes integrable with computer networks. Embedded com- puters or visual markers on everyday objects allow things and information about them to be accessible in the digi- tal world. However, this integration is based on competing standards and requires custom solutions, thus requires ex- tensive time and technical expertise. Based on the success of Web 2.0 mashup applications, we propose a similar ap- proach for integrating real-world devices to the Web, allow- ing for them to be easily combined with other virtual and physical resources. In this paper we discuss possible inte- gration method, in particular how the REST principles can be applied to embedded devices. Then we illustrate these principles with two concrete implementations: on the Sun SPOT platform and on the Ploggs wireless energy monitors. Finally, we show how RESTful interactions can be leveraged to quickly create new prototypes and mashups that combine the physical and virtual world.},

abstract = {This paper presents the methodology for the synthesis of real-time applications working in the "Internet of Things" environment. We propose the client-server architecture, where embedded systems act as smart clients and the Internet application is a server of the system. The architecture of the application conforms to the cloud computing model. Since centralized systems are prone to bottlenecks caused by accumulation of transmissions or computations, we propose the distributed architecture of the server and the methodology that constructs this architecture using Internet resources supported by a cloud provider. We assume that the function of the server is specified as a set of distributed algorithms, and then our methodology schedules all tasks on the available network infrastructure. It takes into account limited bandwidth of communication channels as well as the limited computation power of server nodes. The method minimizes the cost of using network resources that are necessary to execute all tasks in real-time. We also present a sample application for adaptive control of traffic in a smart city, which shows the benefits of using our methodology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Rather than exposing real-world data and functionality through vertical system designs, we propose to make them an integral part of the Web. As a result, smart things become easier to build upon. In such an architecture, popular Web technologies (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, Ajax, PHP, Ruby) can be used to build applications involving smart things, and users can leverage well-known Web mechanisms (e.g., browsing, searching, bookmarking, caching, linking) to interact with and share these devices. In this chapter, we describe the Web of Things (WoT) architecture and best practices based on the RESTful principles that have already contributed to the popular success, scalability, and evolvability of the Web. We discuss several prototypes using these principles, which connect environmental sensor nodes, energy monitoring systems, and RFID-tagged objects to the Web. We also show how Web-enabled smart things can be used in lightweight ad-hoc applications, called “physical Mashups”, and discuss some of the remaining challenges towards the global World Wide Web of Things.},

These devices and platforms define their own way of describing the interactions with the devices and do not support the recently published WoT standards by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). On the other hand, many hardware components that are popular in developer and maker communities lack a programming language independent platform to integrate these components into the WoT, similar to npm and pip for software packages. To solve these problems and nurture the adoption of the W3C WoT, in this paper, we propose a platform to WoTify either existing hardware by downloading new software in them or already existing IoT and WoT devices by describing them with a Thing Description.},

abstract = {Current trends inspired from the development of the Web 2.0 advocate designing smart things (e.g., wireless sensors nodes or home appliances) as service platforms. Interoperable services are mainly achieved using two different approaches: WS-* and RESTful Web services. These approaches have previously been compared with respect to performance and features, but no work has been done to elicit the developers' preferences and programming experiences. We conducted a study in which 69 novice developers learned both technologies and implemented mobile phone applications that retrieve sensor data, both through a RESTful and through a WS-* service architecture. The results complement the available technological decision framework when building Internet of Things applications. The results suggest that developers find REST easier to learn than WS-* and consider it more suitable for programming smart things. However, for applications with advanced security and Quality of Service requirements, WS-* Web services are perceived to be better suited. {\textcopyright} 2012 ICST Institute for Computer Science, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},
